# Configuration
Standard daemon like configuration is handled through a JSON file (though really any `require()`-able file that returns a correctly formatted javascript object will do)

## Schema
please refer to the schema in `/docs/dataSchemas/configurationSchema.json`.


## Examples
You can see example configuration files in the `/examples/` directory.
